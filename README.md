### Source Code

- Scoop<br>
My intention with this WP is that there shall be a little some thing for every body between "New Bee" and "Guru." I also limit my self to talking about "in code stuff" or stuff close to that, the actual code you can use to handle errors in VB, and collect as much information as possible to use when debugging. Therefore, what you will not find is how to avoid errors or how to manage it organizationally.<br>
<br>
 - The accompanying Example Application<br>
 There is an example application, having it open in the VB IDE beside the document when reading makes it allot easier. In the example there is also context sensitive help on the different buttons, connecting the to app the WP (this only works when the application is running). Please download the .zip file below to see the complete tutorial!<br>
